Title: ILoReg: a tool for high-resolution cell population identification from scRNA-Seq data
Version: 0.99.6
Description: ILoReg is a tool for identification of cell populations from scRNA-seq data. In particular, ILoReg is useful for finding cell populations with subtle transcriptomic differences.
              The method utilizes a self-supervised learning method, called Iteratitive Clustering Projection (ICP), to find cluster probabilities, which
              are used in noise reduction prior to PCA and the subsequent hierarchical clustering and t-SNE steps.
              Additionally, functions for differential expression analysis to find gene markers for the populations and gene expression visualization are provided.
