ILoReg News

ILoReg 0.99.0 (Release date: 2020-06-25):

    * The first version 0.99.0 is submitted to Bioconductor

ILoReg 0.99.5 (Release date: 2022-03-03):

    * An updated version 0.99.5 is submitted to GitHub.
    Includes an experimental feature that can be used to accelerate the ICP.
    "icp.batch.size" parameter in RunParallelICP can be set to, e.g. 2000
    to use 2000 cells when learning the model. When running ICP
    in parallel, the order of the ICP runs in the result list was previously 
    random, which affected the the principal components and
    the visualizations using t-SNE/UMAP. The ICP runs are now sorted based on
    the standard deviation of the probability matrices, which will very likely
    always produce the same order and the same visualizations. Finally, there
    was one bug that affected the DE analysis. The logFC values were by mistake
    retransformed to log-scale. Now the average values of the two groups are
    subtracted. The pseudocount.use parameter was removed. The method now
    assumes that the input data are log-transformed.
