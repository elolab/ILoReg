ILoReg News

ILoReg 0.99.0 (Release date: 2020-06-25):

    * The first version 0.99.0 is submitted to Bioconductor

ILoReg 0.99.5 (Release date: 2021-11-24):

    * An updated version 0.99.5 is submitted to Bioconductor.
    Includes an experimental feature that can be used to accelerate the ICP.
    "icp.batch.size" parameter in RunParallelICP can be set to, e.g. 2000
    to use 2000 cells when learning the model. In addition, when running ICP
    in parallel, the order of the ICP runs in the result list was slightly
    random, which affected the sign of the principal components and
    the visualizations using t-SNE/UMAP. The ICP runs are now sorted based on
    the standard deviation of the probability matrices, which will very likely
    always produce the same order and the same visualizations.
